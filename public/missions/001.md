## The Long Night

The city has gone to chaos and the streets are on fire. Find some way to mitigate the damage, or escape before it's too late.

Members of one of the location raider groups have set into action a plan to siege the northern districts of Srada. There is currently no knowledge of how far the assault spreads but what is important right now is to deal with your immediate situation.

# Goals
- Survive or Escape.

# Stakes
- The north districts are lost, navigation of the city is difficult. You may require a different means of getting by, or to find a different planet to rest at.

# Reserves
