Andy Altman comes from a long line of nobles, on a far off planet covered in red dust and brush. It is there they hold the last remaining unaltered ranch and farm animals from Earth, which they sell the product of at an exorbitant price. Andy has known nothing but leisure, and spends most of his time studying the culture of the old world. It was there he discovered tales of the wild west, gunslingers, and outlaws. Enamored, Andy spent the remainder of his abundant free time tracking down relics of the past and pouring time into learning how to use guns. Then, with only his own grit, desire, and talent (along with a large sum of money from his father) Andy went out into the world to pursue his dream of becoming...a cowboy.
