With new information in hand, the spends the day running tests on the mimicry fluid received from the Idealist and comparing it the sample that Cventanka had received
on the day of the first attack. After running some tests at the JMR agency, both Cvetanka and the scientist note the substance to be of a similar worldly material that NHPs are constructed from, or at least sourced from a similar system. To better combat new potential threats, more resources are allocated to the team, and Viktor sets about starting to upgrade the teams mechs.

Across the city, Tristan finishes his meetings in Bayside Devom and makes his way towards Viktor's shop when he notices a man in a lab coat enter the Oracle Brewing company. Following after the figure Tristan finds Fraldy Nera, a previous engineer at JMR drinking at the bar. Seeing an opportunity, Tristan recruits Fraldy into the Band of Crowns as of his "cooks" before leaving at making his way back to Viktor's shop.

Prior to finishing his bounty work in Centermont, Andy observes a number of suspiciously dressed figures patrolling the district. Asking some locals, he learns that they belong to one of the investigation squads of the Crowin family. Not wanting to attract any attention, Andy quickly leaves Centermont and makes his way to Viktor's shop in Talnand.

Entering Viktor's shop, Andy finds Tristan in the mostly stripped down building tearing his mech apart while chanting various mantras and phrases. While Andy attempts to make conversation and shake him out of it, Tristan isn't deterred and doesn't break his stupor until his mech has been completely remodeled. After coming back to consciousness, both of them discuss the current dealings in the city and Andy's encounter with the Crowin investigators. Tristan informs him of the past connection with the Crowin and Ocano families and the small contract they had attempted with the Band of Crowns. Putting the pieces together, they decide to launch a plan to infiltrate a party hosted by the nobility.

While others are working, Damir is spending time closing out a bar in Schad Heights, he spends his time drinking until he is kicked out of the bar and heads towards Viktor's. Drunkenly stumbling in and hearing about their plan, Damir offers some information on noble parties and military galas that are commonly hosted in Yolpaif Circle. With a target, Tristan starts hacking into local registries and forging identities for the team to enter the party. After accessing the registry, Tristan implants some basic identification for all his team members, he also ensures that Andy's identity, that of a local baron has additional documentation and backing to cement the falsification.

With a set of identities in place, the team reconvenes at Archer's spy agency to find a noble party to infiltrate. They land on a party occurring at the Hyacinth Residence. Before the party starts, Archer attempts to run some reconnaissance and determine the layout of the building. In addition to locating the generators at the back of the building, he detects a large power draw from the east side of the second floor. Satisfied, the team then enters the party, attempting to infiltrate the network and get more information out of the building. Before, starting their information gathering, Tristan hands a small information server over to Archer to plant during the operation.

Andy spends the duration of the party on the chatting with guests in the main hall accompanied by Viktor acting as a stand in body guard. Speaking with guests and showing off some tricks, he learns about the host of this party is the Crowin family and they've been said to be more aggressively hunting gangs and raiders in the cities.

While Andy is making himself a known entity at the party, Archer uses the camouflaging
capabilities of his suit to find the room he identified previously. While he was able to identify the correct room, the path was guarded by a set of Crowin Enforcers. Archer calls Tristan to make a minor distraction. Tristan calls one of the guards away from the door and gives Archer enough time to enter the guarded store room. Inside, he finds the entrance to a storage room and slots in Tristan's custom server after downloading a set of access records from the network.

During Archer infiltration work, Tristan is escorted to the game room where he speaks to one of the patrons to learn more about life in high society, using Andy's cover as an out-system baron, he starts speaking of some of the off world colonies that are being created to solve Srada's population and resource issues.

With his mission successful but trapped, Archer call for another one of his companions to create a distraction to leave the server room. Tristan, feeling courageous, attempts to distract the guards again and, while successful, is escorted to one of the servant rooms and made to rest by the palace guards. Though now more under watch, Archer is able to leave the server room with the backdoor installed. While the invisibility allows Archer to escape, the exit isn't unnoticed putting security on alert. Karla, finishing up some other business at the party, greets the members at the guest hall before being called upstairs to where the disturbances are occurring.

Primary objective complete, Archer attempts to search the rest of the mansion. To circumvent the last guard patrol, Brie attempts to distract the remaining guards by screaming in the hallway, while this gives Archer enough time to slip into the last unexplored room, Brie is questioned by the guards and lead back down stairs to bring her benefactor back for questioning.

Back downstairs, Brie is short on time to alert Andy of the current situations, as he is brought upstairs to Karla. Archer, inside the last guarded room finds the first princess Lucia asleep in the room.

Viktor follows Andy upstairs as Brie is left with a location transponder to look for her necklace. Upstairs, Andy, posing as Richy Richmond the noble who brought everyone to the party, is questioned about the team's behavior. Andy gives the cover that he has done nothing of note at the party and his aides and friends are free to do go as they want. Karla insists that Andy gives descriptions on all of the people he entered the party with and gives an order to all security in the mansion to locate the current whereabouts of everyone described.

After a few minutes, Karla confronts Andy again about the disappearance of one of his servants, Archer. Andy gives an excuse that he must have been feeling unwell and left. Having no report of Archer leaving, Karla brings Andy and Viktor back to the Northern Lord's Office in Yolpaif Circle for more questioning and ends the party early. Arhcer uses this opportunity to leave the party unnoticed.

While Andy is being taken to the Lord's offices and being questioned, Tristan sets to work to further cement his disguise as Richy Richmond. He works to forge records for his home world "Planet Texas" and make it seem like an official planet under the control of the Karrakis Trade Baronies.

Inside Yolpaif, Karla pulls records from "Richy's" customs records and tries to validate the identities of him and the people he brought to the party. Andy offers a background for his friends, claiming their his friends who he brought in from outside the system. Due to their limited backgrounds from the initial hacking attempts, Karla comes to a set of different conclusions:

    The Party have been illegally brought into the system by Richy

    Richy is being used/taken advantage of by the party

    Richy is aiding in a form of criminal espionage in the city

Andy assures Karla that they are just his friends and might be too eccentric. Karla then offers Andy an ultimatum, bring her and the investigators to his residence in the city so they can be questioned, or admit to criminal wrong doing. Andy agrees and starts to set off for Centermont. Viktor, who has been waiting in the district office for Andy posing as his bodyguard, is altered to the plan and informs the rest of the party before joining the escort with Andy.

While being taken to Centermont, the party sets up an ambush, and breaks Andy and Viktor away from the convoy before they reach their destination. With not much time left and the Crown on high alert, the team works to start taking down the New Idealist bases and curb their influence.

Working quickly, the team runs through the data available to them and identifies two different operating bases in Upper North Gidlat and Talnand Market. Taking the quicker option the team assaults the closer facility Gidlat.

The Gidlat factory housed both basic production and facilities for the Idealists. After a long battle, the team is able to take control of the building. After short discussions and deciding not the blow the building up, the factory is shut down and the team turns their attention tot the second facility in Talnand.

Entering the facility in Talnand, the team finds it mostly empty. No personnel are left in the facility except for a few guards a one notable person, the smuggler Bjorn Solari. Remembering his old contract for the smuggler, Andy rushes in to claim the bounty. While not a member the Idealist faction, Bjorn defends the base and is aided in a similar fashion to other Idealist leaders by composite frames produced by the mimicry substance. After disabling his mech, Andy pins Bjorn under his mech and starts to try and get some information out of him. After some minor questioning, he attempts to push the blame on his employers and gives some information on at least the source of the mimicry fluid, the colony planet Artos.

In the mean time, Archer attempts to shutdown the facility like others before him but fumbles the controls and releases a large quantity of the mimicry fluid out from the storerooms. Seeing his mistake, he quickly and quietly exists the building before Viktor takes to the controls and shuts down the lab. Moving to the store room to check, Viktor notes that the escaped fluid has found a way to seep out of the walls and escape the building.

After finishing up at the Talnand facility, the team moves back the JMR headquarters where Andy attempts to collect on his bounty. Not able to trust enforcement offices and persons in system, he attempts to contact an SSC representative to meet him in a neutral location in the city, Archer's old apartment.

The representative didn't give a name, but mention knowing of Andy's family for their supply of cows and other animals. While annoyed that the contact wasn't aware of his bounty hunting career, Bjorn was handed over and a contact was forged with SSC for any other information on their missing resources and research items. Back at the agency, Viktor and Tristan go over the data from the raids and attempt to pinpoint the location of the gang leader. Tristan allows Viktor to use his data stores and NHP to go over what was found, and find the base in Upper North Gidlat. The team sets up a surveillance feed and notes a series of regular patrols, but no other security from the outside. Damir attempts to do a light recon with Archer and while the building appears to be  a regular residential building, a sizable number of workers can be seen exiting the building at certain hours.

To complete the infiltration, the team concocts a plan to pose as a cleaning service entering the building and have Viktor and Tristan's NHP provide support hacking remotely. Tristan uses his organization the Band of Crowns to acquire a cleaning van and uniforms and also sets about setting a, relatively shoddy, website to fake legitimacy.

The team infiltrates the facility and secures Altert Murphy in the process.
