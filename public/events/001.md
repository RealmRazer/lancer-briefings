# Meccov::Talnand Market // 5.21.50XXu
Dawn breaks in the capital city of Srada. Archer Silver is briefed about some increase in gang and raider activity in the city. A top class spy, he is passed a contract by his mother to pose as an arms dealer and make contact with one of the cities local criminal gangs to pass of armaments and start learning more about them. Archer takes a hold of the 40 explosives to deal pass onto the gang, given some assurance that they've been disarmed. Archer pockets 6 and completes the deal, attempting to also romance his contact Ulla Zemke.

Across the town, two bounty hunters have arrived looking for their recent quarry, a smuggler by the name Bjorn Solari. Information gathering is slow but Andy Altman, a noble of some lineage, is able to procure a mount from a local merchant and parade it around the district. To curb the attention that they are drawing, Andy's babysitter Brie O'Brien wrestles the steed to the ground and proclaims that the noble didn't capture the steed himself. For displaying some prowess, the pair are approached by a citizen talking about the recent increase in crime seen in the poorer districts of the city. Both decide to take on the gang activity, putting off learning about their bounty and seek the lower districts as well as a place to repair their mechs.

In the waterways of north Srada, Tristan Karkov wakes up from a previous bender. Running low on drugs and money, Tristan contacts his old friend from the Band of Crows, Fox "Wilfred" Leath,about any upcoming jobs. Wilfred tells him about a recent job that's been passed down the to the Crows about simple delivery work; while not the most exciting work, it promises more opportunity for people sporting the name of the Crowns. He is given a number of bombs to disperse around the poorer district for his delivery.

Near the old barracks and government quarter, and old soldier and PMC, Damir "Petrov" RadoniÄ‡, is resting after a recent mission and deployment. Seeking repairs for his mech he starts asking around and draws attention from some locals. Seeing the situation start to go south, Damir ducks into the allies and loses his pursuers. After some time, he lands in front of a repair shop run by the mechanic Victor Murakami.

Viktor meets with Damir and agrees to service is mech, but also notes that he's been running low on materials for his fabricator; deliveries of materials are lacking in recent months and parts are coming at a premium. During the repair process, a cloaked figure enters the shop asking for a quick fabrication to create a small casing for a bomb. Viktor accepts the job and works to complete it along side his other repair job. Shortly after, Andy and Brie both enter the shop and ask for upkeep on their mechs as well.

After being handed the bombs, Tristan does some investigations and realizes what they are. He attempts to disarm them, but in his failed attempts learns two things: these bombs have some network activation capability, and someone now knows they've been tampered with. Tristan chucks his explosives into a nearby water way where they explode, damaging the structure. He attempts to get a hold of Wilfred to dispose of the other bombs, but fails to convince him to continue handling the explosives. Wilfred leaves the explosives at his last location, and Tristan moves towards his last location, with his mech following behind.

In a small research lab a scientist, Cvetanka Solverson, is running her lab when she receives a delivery. She is asked to sign for a package containing new materials for the lab. Opening the box she finds a large box, containing a black substance that when manipulated, appears as a cloth like material. Any time to inspect the material is cut short as a number of cloaked figures stream into the lab. The figures demand any recent packages and deliveries before assaulting the research staff and leaving explosives to detonate when they don't find what they want. Surviving the explosion with the package damaged and partially missing, Cvetanka departs the research lab with a station security mech to brave the streets.

After finishing the repairs for all of the mechs, Viktor completes the case for the explosive that was requested. Not long after, the device is remotely activated and Viktor rushes to throw the charge in an abandoned building near the back of his work shop.

Nearby, Archer accompanies Ulla through the Tanlan Market to oversee elements of the operation before moving on to next phases. During the ride, some bombs that Archer had previously stashed start to activate and Archer disposes of them by throwing them at the steed that Andy had previously bought. Ulla, being surprised by the operation hitting so close to the area she is patrolling, leaves Archer and goes off to determine what is happening with the operation.

Now in the same area, the party starts to be harried by enemies sweeping the streets of the district. They clear the area of any enemies and, using previously gained information that the source of the signals controlling the explosives comes from underground, make for the sewers under Talnand. The team finds the Communication Nexus and after clearing out some infantry and a Commander for the raider gang, extract the device from the sewers.
